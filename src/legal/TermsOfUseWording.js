##### Description of Service

GammaDEX provides an online platform for users to trade Tokens ("Digital Assets", "Funds", "Ethereum-based Tokens") based on the Ethereum Blockchain. The price of a trade is determined by the users involved in the trade, the buyer and seller. GammaDEX is not the buyer or seller of these trades.

The GammaDEX trading platform provides the user with convenient access to: infura.io (a third party Public Ethereum Access Provider), the EtherDelta.com Exchange Smart Contract ("EtherDelta", "EtherDelta Smart Contract", "Third Party Smart Contract", "Smart Contract"), Third Party EtherDelta-compatible Order lists ("Order Books"), the Ethereum Network, Ethereum-based Tokens, all collectively third party services ("Third Party Applications") unaffiliated with GammaDEX. User funds are held directly in the Third Party Smart Contract. Only the user who owns those funds can deposit, withdraw or exchange those funds with other users from the Third Party Smart Contract. GammaDEX does not have access to user funds, nor can GammaDEX execute trades or create orders on the user's behalf. The Third Party Smart Contract runs on the Ethereum Main Network.

###### Depositing and Withdrawing Tokens

Through the GammaDEX website user's can send ("Deposit") Ether and Ethereum-based Tokens from a supported digital wallet (private key-based, JSON keystore file, MetaMask or Hardware Wallet) to the EtherDelta Smart Contract. Deposits and Withdrawals take the form of Ethereum Transactions authorized by You the wallet owner and submitted to the Ethereum Network. Once funds are deposited to the EtherDelta Smart Contract, they can be exchanged with other users either by (a) making Orders and waiting for another user to take your Order, or (b) taking another user's existing Order.

GammaDEX does not have access to your funds and is not able to deposit to or withdraw from the Smart Contract without your authorization. By using GammaDEX to deposit or withdraw Ether or Ethereum-based Tokens you do so at your own risk. GammaDEX does not guarantee the successful execution of, accuracy, timeliness, validity or integrity of Ethereum Transactions sent on Your behalf. You agree not to hold GammaDEX responsible for losses of any form incurred in any way from depositing or withdrawing Ether or digital assets on the website.

###### Making Orders

There are two parties ("users") involved when trading Tokens on the Exchange Smart Contract: An Order Maker and Order Taker.

GammaDEX allows the user to create EtherDelta-compatible Orders. An Order is a message describing an intent to trade a defined amount of one Token for a defined amount of another Token. The message is digitally signed by the User to prove authenticity. The order has a user defined expiry time (measured in Ethereum blocks) and a price implied by the Token amounts defined by the user.

Once an Order is created, no trade or tranfer of tokens happens immediately. The Maker of the Order must wait for a taker to create a trade against an order at which point Tokens will move between the maker and taker.

GammaDEX displays lists of buy and sell orders ("Order Books", "Books", "Book") for Tokens. The orders that appear in the Book are gathered from GammaDEX directly and other third parties that gather EtherDelta-compatible orders. Orders created on the GammaDEX website are also published to other third parties, though this happens with no guarantee. By using this service you agree to Orders being published to third parties in this way and with no guarantee.

###### Cancelling Orders
